# What it does

Hi
One issue that is always raised is why do some servers look more realistic?
Well its easy to answer (weather)
This simple but useful script I prepared for you will allow you to make the map and image that the user looks real.
The colors become clearer and the dust is removed

# Installation

Enter the script folder of your resource folder
Start the ata_removefog resource in .cfg file

# Preview
